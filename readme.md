# Plague-Modeling
A repository of MATLAB codes to simulate plague dynamics with cryptic amoeba reservoirs. 
## To run the models:
* `run_stoch_model_w_amoeba.m` is a script to run the stochastic model. 
* `run_ode_model.m` is a script to run a deterministic version of the model. 

All other scripts can be used to analyze trajectories and reproduce manuscript figures. Parameter sweeps were performed on the SUMMIT cluster at CU Boulder, and model variant simulations were performed on the WM Keck Cluster at Colorado State University.
