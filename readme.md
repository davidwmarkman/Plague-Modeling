# Plague-Modeling
A repository of MATLAB codes to simulate plague dynamics with cryptic amoeba reservoirs. 
## To run the models:
* `run_stoch_model_w_amoeba.m` is a script to run the stochastic model. 
* `run_ode_model.m` is a script to run a deterministic version of the model. 

All other scripts can be used to analyze trajectories and reproduce manuscript figures. Parameter sweeps were performed on the [RMACC SUMMIT cluster](https://www.colorado.edu/rc/resources/summit) at CU Boulder, and model variant simulations were performed on the [WM Keck Cluster](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/ens/info/researchcomputing/cluster/) at Colorado State University.
